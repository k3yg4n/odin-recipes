        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>What makes the perfect cookie? They have to be soft, but not fluffy. They have to be chewy and a little crispy around the edges. They can't be too thick, but they can't be too thin. Sounds impossible to achieve right? However, these Oatmeal Butterscotch Cookies (also called Oatmeal Scotchies) are soft, chewy, and loaded with butterscotch chips! No chilling required!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 ⅔ cups butterscotch chips</li>
        </ul>
